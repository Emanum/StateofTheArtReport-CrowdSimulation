	abstract = {Simulating believable virtual crowds has been an important research topic in many research fields such as industry films, computer games, urban engineering, and behavioral science. One of the key capabilities agents should have is navigation, which is reaching goals without colliding with other agents or obstacles. The key challenge here is that the environment changes dynamically, where the current decision of an agent can largely affect the state of other agents as well as the agent in the future. Recently, reinforcement learning with deep neural networks has shown remarkable results in sequential decision-making problems. With the power of convolution neural networks, elaborate control with visual sensory inputs has also become possible. In this paper, we present an agent-based deep reinforcement learning approach for navigation, where only a simple reward function enables agents to navigate in various complex scenarios. Our method is also able to do that with a single unified policy for every scenario, where the scenario-specific parameter tuning is unnecessary. We will show the effectiveness of our method through a variety of scenarios and settings.},

	abstract = {In the everyday exercise of controlling their locomotion, humans rely on their optic flow of the perceived environment to achieve collision-free navigation. In crowds, in spite of the complexity of the environment made of numerous obstacles, humans demonstrate remarkable capacities in avoiding collisions. Cognitive science work on human locomotion states that relatively succinct information is extracted from the optic flow to achieve safe locomotion. In this paper, we explore a novel vision-based approach of collision avoidance between walkers that fits the requirements of interactive crowd simulation. By simulating humans based on cognitive science results, we detect future collisions as well as the level of danger from visual stimuli. The motor-response is twofold: a reorientation strategy prevents future collision, whereas a deceleration strategy prevents imminent collisions. Several examples of our simulation results show that the emergence of self-organized patterns of walkers is reinforced using our approach. The emergent phenomena are visually appealing. More importantly, they improve the overall efficiency of the walkers' traffic and avoid improbable locking situations.},

By applying a combination of psychological and geometrical rules with a social and physical forces model, HiDAC exhibits a wide variety of emergent behaviors from agent line formation to pushing behavior and its consequences; relative to the current situation, personalities of the individuals and perceived social density.},

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

In this paper we present a new approach to controlling the behavior of agents in a crowd. Our method is scalable in the sense that increasingly complex crowd behaviors can be created without a corresponding increase in the complexity of the agents. Our approach is also more authorable; users can dynamically specify which crowd behaviors happen in various parts of an environment. Finally, the character motion produced by our system is visually convincing. We achieve our aims with a situation-based control structure. Basic agents have very limited behaviors. As they enter new situations, additional, situation-specific behaviors are composed on the fly to enable agents to respond appropriately. The composition is done using a probabilistic mechanism.

For most of the applications of crowds, it is now a requirement to have real-time simulations – which is an additional challenge, particularly when crowds are very large.Crowd Simulation analyses these challenges in depth and suggests many possible solutions.

	abstract = {ÐThis paper describes a model for simulating crowds of humans in real time. We deal with a hierarchy composed of virtual crowds, groups, and individuals. The groups are the most complex structure that can be controlled in different degrees of autonomy. This autonomy refers to the extent to which the virtual agents are independent of user intervention and also the amount of information needed to simulate crowds. Thus, depending on the complexity of the simulation, simple behaviors can be sufficient to simulate crowds. Otherwise, more complicated behavioral rules can be necessary and, in this case, it can be included in the simulation data in order to improve the realism of the animation. We present three different ways for controlling crowd behaviors: 1) by using innate and scripted behaviors, 2) by defining behavioral rules, using events and reactions, and 3) by providing an external control to guide crowd behaviors in real time. The two main contributions of our approach are: the possibility of increasing the complexity of group/agent behaviors according to the problem to be simulated and the hierarchical structure based on groups to compose a crowd.},

The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {The equations of motion governing the two-dimensional flow of pedestrians are derived for flows of both single and multiple pedestrian types. Two regimes of flow, a high-density (subcritical) and a low-density (supercritical) flow regimes, are possible, rather than two flow regimes for each type of pedestrian. A subcritical flow always fills the space available. However, a supercritical flow may either fill the space available or be self-confining for each type of pedestrian, depending on the boundary location. Although, the equations governing these flows are simultaneous, time-dependent, non-linear, partial differential equations, remarkably they may be made conformally mappable. The solution of these equations becomes trivial in many situations. Free streamline calculations, utilizing this property, reveal both upstream and downstream separation of the flow of pedestrians around an obstacle. Such analysis tells much about the nature of the assumptions used in various models for the flow of pedestrians. The present theory is designed for the development of general techniques to understand the motion of large crowds. However, it is also useful as a predictive tool. The behavior predicted by these equations of motion is compared with aerial observations for the Jamarat Bridge near Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is shown that, for this important case, pedestrians, that is pilgrims, aim at achieving each immediate goal in minimum time rather than achieving all goals in overall minimum time. Typical of many examples, this case illustrated the strong dependence of path on the psychological state of the pedestrians involved. It is proposed that the flow of pedestrians over the Jamarat Bridge be improved by appropriate barrier placement, that force an effective global view of the goals.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to simulate virtual human crowds in emergency situations. Our model is based on two previous works, on a physical model proposed by Helbing, where individuals are represented by a particle system affected by "social forces" that impels them to go to a point-objective, while avoiding collisions with obstacles and other agents. As a new property, the virtual agents are endowed with different attributes and individualities as proposed by Braun et al. The main contributions of this paper are the treatment of complex environments and their implications on agents' movement, the management of alarms distributed in space, the virtual agents endowed with perception of emergency events and their consequent reaction as well as changes in their individualities. The prototype reads a XML file where different scenarios can be simulated, such as the characteristics of population, the virtual scene description, the alarm configuration and the properties of hazardous events. As output, the prototype generates information in order to measure the impact of parameters on saved, injured and dead agents. In addition, some results and validation are discussed.},

The proposed method is based on a combination of cage-based deformation and as-rigid-as-possible deformation with a set of constraints integrated into the system to produce desired results. Our system allows animators to edit existing crowd animations intuitively with real-time performance while maintaining complex interactions between individual characters. Our examples demonstrate how our cage-based user interfaces mitigate the time and effort for the user to manipulate large crowd animation.},

Most of the research efforts have been directed towards improving rendering or behavior control; the question how to author crowd scenes in an efficient way is usually not addressed. We introduce a novel approach to create complex scenes involving thousands of animated individuals in a simple and intuitive way. By employing a brush metaphor, analogous to the tools used in image manipulation programs, we can distribute, modify and control crowd members in real-time with immediate visual feedback. We define concepts of operators and instance properties that allow to create and manage variety in populations of virtual humans. An efficient technique allowing to render up to several thousands of fully three-dimensional polygonal characters with keyframed animations at interactive framerates is presented. The potential of our approach is demonstrated by authoring a scenario of a virtual audience in a theater and a scenario of a pedestrian crowd in a city.},

	abstract = {Path planning and crowd simulation are important computational tasks in computer games and applications of high social relevance, such as crowd management and safety training. Virtual characters (agents) need to autonomously find a path from their current position to a designated goal position. This is usually solved by running the A* algorithm on a grid or a navigation mesh. However, in many modern applications, strictly traversing the resulting path is not sufficient. Agents need to be able to deviate from these paths, e.g. to avoid each other or react to dynamic changes in the environment. Multiple levels of planning are necessary to efficiently simulate realistic behavior, and the underlying data structures and algorithms should support those levels. Many existing crowd simulation frameworks do not have this flexibility. In this paper, we propose a five-level hierarchy for agent navigation in virtual environments. The five levels are high-level planning, global route planning, route following, local movement, and animation. The three center levels concern geometric planning and require a navigation mesh that represents the navigable space of the environment. We describe an efficient and flexible navigation mesh for 2D and multi-layered 3D environments. We also present our crowd simulation software that uses this mesh; we outline its architecture and show that the framework is easily extendible. Finally, we show that our software can simulate large autonomous crowds in real-time.},

Besides LoD approaches, we review classic acceleration schemes, such as frustum culling and occlusion culling, and describe how they can be adapted to handle crowds of animated characters. We also discuss specific acceleration techniques for crowd rendering, such as primitive pseudo-instancing, palette skinning, and dynamic key-pose caching, which benefit from current graphics hardware.

To this end, much effort has been put into creating variety in character representation and animation. Nevertheless, one aspect still lacking realism in virtual crowd characters resides in their attention behaviors. In this paper, we propose a framework to add gaze attention behaviors to crowd animations. First, we automatically extract interest points from character or object trajectories in pre- existing animations. For a given character, we assign a set of elementary scores based on parameters such as distance or speed to all other characters or objects in the scene. We then combine these subscores in an overall scoring function. The scores obtained from this function form a set of gaze constraints that determine where and when each character should look. We finally enforce these constraints with an optimized dedicated gaze Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver. It first computes the displacement maps for the constraints to be satisfied. It then smoothly propagates these displacements over an automatically defined number of frames. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method and our visually convincing results through various examples. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	copyright = {open},
	url = {https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1363354/},
	abstract = {This thesis describes the design, implementation and application of an integrated and fully
automated system for interpreting whole-body range data.
The system is shown to be capable of generating complete surface models of human bodies, and
robustly extracting anatomical features for anthropometry, with minimal intrusion on the
subject. The ability to automate this process has enormous potential for personalised digital
models in medicine, ergonomics, design and manufacture and for populating virtual
environments. The techniques developed within this thesis now form the basis of a commercial
product.
However, the technical difficulties are considerable. Human bodies are highly varied and many
of the features of interest are extremely subtle. The underlying range data is typically noisy and
is sparse at occluded areas. In addressing these problems this thesis makes five main research
contributions.
Firstly, the thesis describes the design, implementation and testing of the whole integrated and
automated system from scratch, starting at the image capture hardware. At each stage the tradeoffs
between performance criteria are discussed, and experiments are described to test the
processes developed.
Secondly, a combined data-driven and model-based approach is described and implemented, for
surface reconstruction from the raw data. This method addresses the whole body surface,
including areas where body segments touch, and other occluded areas.
The third contribution is a library of operators, designed specifically for shape description and
measurement of the human body. The library provides high-level relational attributes, an
"electronic tape measure" to extract linear and curvilinear measurements,as well as low-level
shape information, such as curvature.
Application of the library is demonstrated by building a large set of detectors to find
anthropometric features, based on the ISO 8559 specification. Output is compared against
traditional manual measurements and a detailed analysis is presented. The discrepancy between
these sets of data is only a few per cent on most dimensions, and the system's reproducibility is
shown to be similar to that of skilled manual measurers.
The final contribution is that the mesh models and anthropometric features, produced by the
system, have been used as a starting point to facilitate other research, Such as registration of
multiple body images,draping clothing and advanced surface modelling techniques.},

Our technique is based on the spatiotemporal analysis of the deforming apparent contour of a human moving according to a protocol of movements. For generality and robustness our technique does not use a prior model of the human body and a prior body part segmentation is not assumed. Therefore, our technique applies to humans of any anthropometric dimension. To parameterize and segment over time a deforming apparent contour, we introduce a new shape representation technique based on primitive composition. The composed deformable model allows us to represent large local deformations and their evolution in a compact and intuitive way. In addition, this representation allows us to hypothesize an underlying part structure and test this hypothesis against the relative motion (due to forces exerted from the image data) of the defining primitives of the composed model. Furthermore, we develop a Human Body Part Decomposition Algorithm (HBPDA) that recovers all the body parts of a subject by monitoring the changes over time to the shape of the deforming silhouette. In addition, we modularize the process of simultaneous two-dimensional part determination and shape estimation by employing the Supervisory Control Theory of Discrete Event Systems. Finally, we present a novel algorithm which selectively integrates the (segmented by the HBPDA) apparent contours from three mutually orthogonal viewpoints to obtain a three-dimensional model of the subject's body parts. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments where a subject performs a set of movements according to a protocol that reveals the structure of the human body.},

In this paper we show that, given video sequences of a person moving in front of the camera, we can recover shape information and joint locations. Both of which are essential to instantiate a complete and realistic model that closely resembles a specific person and without knowledge about the position of the articulations a character cannot be animated.

Such information, however, does not generally specify one's heading. Passing in front of a moving object entails retro-grade motion of objects in the deep background; collisions entail the lamellar pattern of optical flow; and passing behind entails more nearly uniform flow against one's direction of motion. Accuracy in the laboratory compares favorably with that of real-world necessities.},

In this paper, we describe the basic techniques that are by now well established in the field. We first give a general overview of the formulation of the visual servo control problem. We then describe the two archetypal visual servo control schemes: image-based and position-based visual servo control. Finally, we discuss performance and stability issues that pertain to these two schemes, motivating the second article in the series, in which we consider advanced techniques},

It has grown into a recognized discipline with its own journals, conferences, and a large community of active researchers. The suc­ cess of the field as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains-computer graphics, geographic in­ formation systems (GIS), robotics, and others-in which geometric algorithms playafundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or difficult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simplified many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modem algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience. The book has been written as a textbook for a course in computational geometry, but it can also be used for self-study.},

With these new techniques, we are able to use a full dynamic animation range in the crowd populating the Aphrodisias odeon (which is part of the ERATO project), i.e., a greater repertoire of animations, smooth transitions and more variety and speed. We show how a multi-view of the rendering data can ensure good batching of rendering primitives and comfortable constant time access.},

The book reviews present knowledge of somatotypes around the world, how they change with growth, aging and exercise, and the contributions of genetics and environment to the rating. Also reviewed are the relationships among somatotypes and sport, physical performance, health and behavior.},

	title = {The varieties of human physique},
	abstract = {Based on a detailed study of frontal, dorsal and lateral photographs of 4000 male subjects of college age, a 3 dimensional scheme for describing human physique is formulated. Kretschmer's constitutional typology is discarded in favor of one based on 3 first order variables or components, endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy, each of which is found in an individual physique and indicated by one of a set of 3 numerals designating a somatotype or patterning of these morphological components. Seventy-six different somatotypes are described and illustrated. These somatotypical designations are objectively assigned on the basis of the use of 18 anthropometric indices. Second-order variables also isolated and studied are dysplasia, gynandromorphy, texture and hirsutism. Historical trends in constitutional research are summarized. A detailed description is given of the development of the somatotyping technique combining anthroposcopic and anthropometric methods. Reference is made to somatotyping with the aid of a specially devised machine. Topics discussed include: the choice of variables, morphological scales, a geometrical representation of somatotypes, the independence of components, correlational data, the problem of norms, the modifiability of a somatotype, hereditary and endocrine influences and the relation of constitution to temperament, mental disease, clinical studies, crime and delinquency, and the differential education of children. Descriptive sketches of variants of the ectomorphic components are given. Appendices list tables for somatotyping and a series of drawings of 9 female somatotypes. An annotated bibliography is followed by a more general one. 272 photographs and drawings illustrate the somatotypes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The simulation of large crowds of humans is important in many fields of computer graphics, including real-time applications such as games, as they can breathe life into otherwise static scenes and enhance believability. We present a novel hybrid rendering system for crowds that solves the classic problem of degraded quality of image-based representations at close distances by building an impostor rendering system on top of a full, geometry-based, human animation system. This enables almost imperceptible switching between the two representations based on a "pixel to texel" ratio, with minimal popping artefacts. Seamless interchanges are further facilitated by exploiting programmable graphics hardware to efficiently enhance the realism and variety of the dynamically-lit impostors, thereby also improving on existing impostor techniques. To test our system, our virtual crowds are embedded in an urban simulation system (as shown in Figure 1). The results demonstrate a system capable of rendering large realistic crowds with the visual realism of a high-resolution geometry rendering system, but at a fraction of the rendering cost.},
