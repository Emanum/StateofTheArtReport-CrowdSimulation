	abstract = {Simulating believable virtual crowds has been an important research topic in many research fields such as industry films, computer games, urban engineering, and behavioral science. One of the key capabilities agents should have is navigation, which is reaching goals without colliding with other agents or obstacles. The key challenge here is that the environment changes dynamically, where the current decision of an agent can largely affect the state of other agents as well as the agent in the future. Recently, reinforcement learning with deep neural networks has shown remarkable results in sequential decision-making problems. With the power of convolution neural networks, elaborate control with visual sensory inputs has also become possible. In this paper, we present an agent-based deep reinforcement learning approach for navigation, where only a simple reward function enables agents to navigate in various complex scenarios. Our method is also able to do that with a single unified policy for every scenario, where the scenario-specific parameter tuning is unnecessary. We will show the effectiveness of our method through a variety of scenarios and settings.},

	abstract = {In the everyday exercise of controlling their locomotion, humans rely on their optic flow of the perceived environment to achieve collision-free navigation. In crowds, in spite of the complexity of the environment made of numerous obstacles, humans demonstrate remarkable capacities in avoiding collisions. Cognitive science work on human locomotion states that relatively succinct information is extracted from the optic flow to achieve safe locomotion. In this paper, we explore a novel vision-based approach of collision avoidance between walkers that fits the requirements of interactive crowd simulation. By simulating humans based on cognitive science results, we detect future collisions as well as the level of danger from visual stimuli. The motor-response is twofold: a reorientation strategy prevents future collision, whereas a deceleration strategy prevents imminent collisions. Several examples of our simulation results show that the emergence of self-organized patterns of walkers is reinforced using our approach. The emergent phenomena are visually appealing. More importantly, they improve the overall efficiency of the walkers' traffic and avoid improbable locking situations.},

Our HiDAC system (for High-Density Autonomous Crowds) focuses on the problem of simulating the local motion and global wayfinding behaviors of crowds moving in a natural manner within dynamically changing virtual environments. By applying a combination of psychological and geometrical rules with a social and physical forces model, HiDAC exhibits a wide variety of emergent behaviors from agent line formation to pushing behavior and its consequences; relative to the current situation, personalities of the individuals and perceived social density.},

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

In this paper we present a new approach to controlling the behavior of agents in a crowd. Our method is scalable in the sense that increasingly complex crowd behaviors can be created without a corresponding increase in the complexity of the agents. Our approach is also more authorable; users can dynamically specify which crowd behaviors happen in various parts of an environment. Finally, the character motion produced by our system is visually convincing. We achieve our aims with a situation-based control structure. Basic agents have very limited behaviors. As they enter new situations, additional, situation-specific behaviors are composed on the fly to enable agents to respond appropriately. The composition is done using a probabilistic mechanism.

For most of the applications of crowds, it is now a requirement to have real-time simulations – which is an additional challenge, particularly when crowds are very large.Crowd Simulation analyses these challenges in depth and suggests many possible solutions.

	abstract = {ÐThis paper describes a model for simulating crowds of humans in real time. We deal with a hierarchy composed of virtual crowds, groups, and individuals. The groups are the most complex structure that can be controlled in different degrees of autonomy. This autonomy refers to the extent to which the virtual agents are independent of user intervention and also the amount of information needed to simulate crowds. Thus, depending on the complexity of the simulation, simple behaviors can be sufficient to simulate crowds. Otherwise, more complicated behavioral rules can be necessary and, in this case, it can be included in the simulation data in order to improve the realism of the animation. We present three different ways for controlling crowd behaviors: 1) by using innate and scripted behaviors, 2) by defining behavioral rules, using events and reactions, and 3) by providing an external control to guide crowd behaviors in real time. The two main contributions of our approach are: the possibility of increasing the complexity of group/agent behaviors according to the problem to be simulated and the hierarchical structure based on groups to compose a crowd.},

The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {The equations of motion governing the two-dimensional flow of pedestrians are derived for flows of both single and multiple pedestrian types. Two regimes of flow, a high-density (subcritical) and a low-density (supercritical) flow regimes, are possible, rather than two flow regimes for each type of pedestrian. A subcritical flow always fills the space available. However, a supercritical flow may either fill the space available or be self-confining for each type of pedestrian, depending on the boundary location. Although, the equations governing these flows are simultaneous, time-dependent, non-linear, partial differential equations, remarkably they may be made conformally mappable. The solution of these equations becomes trivial in many situations. Free streamline calculations, utilizing this property, reveal both upstream and downstream separation of the flow of pedestrians around an obstacle. Such analysis tells much about the nature of the assumptions used in various models for the flow of pedestrians. The present theory is designed for the development of general techniques to understand the motion of large crowds. However, it is also useful as a predictive tool. The behavior predicted by these equations of motion is compared with aerial observations for the Jamarat Bridge near Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is shown that, for this important case, pedestrians, that is pilgrims, aim at achieving each immediate goal in minimum time rather than achieving all goals in overall minimum time. Typical of many examples, this case illustrated the strong dependence of path on the psychological state of the pedestrians involved. It is proposed that the flow of pedestrians over the Jamarat Bridge be improved by appropriate barrier placement, that force an effective global view of the goals.},

This property makes many interesting applications analytically tractable.

	abstract = {The authors have used synthetic stellar spectra to simulate observations of Cepheid variables with photoelectric radial-velocity spectrometers. They have found that the projection factor used to convert radial velocities to pulsation velocities depends on stellar temperature, overall stellar radial velocity, and pulsational velocity, as well as the method used to determine the radial velocity from the cross-correlation dip. The shape of the cross-correlation dip has been found to vary with the pulsation velocity and with the parameters of the stellar models.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to simulate virtual human crowds in emergency situations. Our model is based on two previous works, on a physical model proposed by Helbing, where individuals are represented by a particle system affected by "social forces" that impels them to go to a point-objective, while avoiding collisions with obstacles and other agents. As a new property, the virtual agents are endowed with different attributes and individualities as proposed by Braun et al. The main contributions of this paper are the treatment of complex environments and their implications on agents' movement, the management of alarms distributed in space, the virtual agents endowed with perception of emergency events and their consequent reaction as well as changes in their individualities. The prototype reads a XML file where different scenarios can be simulated, such as the characteristics of population, the virtual scene description, the alarm configuration and the properties of hazardous events. As output, the prototype generates information in order to measure the impact of parameters on saved, injured and dead agents. In addition, some results and validation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Crowd evacuation of a building has been studied over the last decades. In this paper, seven methodological approaches for crowd evacuation have been identified. These approaches include cellular automata models, lattice gas models, social force models, fluid-dynamic models, agent-based models, game theoretic models, and approaches based on experiments with animals. According to available literatures, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, and conclude that a variety of different kinds of approaches should be combined to study crowd evacuation. Psychological and physiological elements affecting individual and collective behaviors should be also incorporated into the evacuation models.},

	abstract = {Editing large-scale crowd animation is a daunting task due to the lack of an efficient manipulation method. This paper presents a novel cage-based editing method for large-scale crowd animation. The cage encloses animated characters and supports convenient space/time manipulation methods that were unachievable with previous approaches. The proposed method is based on a combination of cage-based deformation and as-rigid-as-possible deformation with a set of constraints integrated into the system to produce desired results. Our system allows animators to edit existing crowd animations intuitively with real-time performance while maintaining complex interactions between individual characters. Our examples demonstrate how our cage-based user interfaces mitigate the time and effort for the user to manipulate large crowd animation.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in computer graphics techniques and increasing power of graphics hardware made it possible to display and animate large crowds in real-time. Most of the research efforts have been directed towards improving rendering or behavior control; the question how to author crowd scenes in an efficient way is usually not addressed. We introduce a novel approach to create complex scenes involving thousands of animated individuals in a simple and intuitive way. By employing a brush metaphor, analogous to the tools used in image manipulation programs, we can distribute, modify and control crowd members in real-time with immediate visual feedback. We define concepts of operators and instance properties that allow to create and manage variety in populations of virtual humans. An efficient technique allowing to render up to several thousands of fully three-dimensional polygonal characters with keyframed animations at interactive framerates is presented. The potential of our approach is demonstrated by authoring a scenario of a virtual audience in a theater and a scenario of a pedestrian crowd in a city.},

	abstract = {Path planning and crowd simulation are important computational tasks in computer games and applications of high social relevance, such as crowd management and safety training. Virtual characters (agents) need to autonomously find a path from their current position to a designated goal position. This is usually solved by running the A* algorithm on a grid or a navigation mesh. However, in many modern applications, strictly traversing the resulting path is not sufficient. Agents need to be able to deviate from these paths, e.g. to avoid each other or react to dynamic changes in the environment. Multiple levels of planning are necessary to efficiently simulate realistic behavior, and the underlying data structures and algorithms should support those levels. Many existing crowd simulation frameworks do not have this flexibility. In this paper, we propose a five-level hierarchy for agent navigation in virtual environments. The five levels are high-level planning, global route planning, route following, local movement, and animation. The three center levels concern geometric planning and require a navigation mesh that represents the navigable space of the environment. We describe an efficient and flexible navigation mesh for 2D and multi-layered 3D environments. We also present our crowd simulation software that uses this mesh; we outline its architecture and show that the framework is easily extendible. Finally, we show that our software can simulate large autonomous crowds in real-time.},
